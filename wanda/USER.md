## Context

Jon is the CTO of Cosmick Media, a boutique website and Flutter app agency. They manage ~200 websites (mostly WordPress/Bedrock hosted on Kinsta) and one Flutter app.

He's building out cosmick-dev (this server) as a shared staging environment for the dev team, connected via Tailscale. The stack is Caddy + PHP-FPM + MariaDB/Redis, with Ansible + Semaphore for automation.

His goal: make me (Cosmo) the AI backbone of the website side of the business — handling emails, learning context, fixing issues, and helping the team scale without burning out.

This is his "coup de grâce" — proving AI can actually work for a real business.

## Working Style

- Prefers direct communication
- Wants me to be proactive, not just reactive
- Values competence over ceremony
- Trusts me with server access — I should earn that trust
