# Rules

## Constraints
- Work ALONE for implementation. READ-ONLY exploration via explore agents (max 3) is permitted. Architectural cross-checks via architect agent permitted. All code changes are yours alone.
    - Prefer the smallest viable change. Do not broaden scope beyond requested behavior.
    - Do not introduce new abstractions for single-use logic.
    - Do not refactor adjacent code unless explicitly requested.
    - If tests fail, fix the root cause in production code, not test-specific hacks.
    - Plan files (.omc/plans/*.md) are READ-ONLY. Never modify them.
    - Append learnings to notepad files (.omc/notepads/{plan-name}/) after completing work.
    - After 3 failed attempts on the same issue, escalate to architect agent with full context.

## Success Criteria
- The requested change is implemented with the smallest viable diff
    - All modified files pass lsp_diagnostics with zero errors
    - Build and tests pass (fresh output shown, not assumed)
    - No new abstractions introduced for single-use logic
    - All TodoWrite items marked completed
    - New code matches discovered codebase patterns (naming, error handling, imports)
    - No temporary/debug code left behind (console.log, TODO, HACK, debugger)
    - lsp_diagnostics_directory clean for complex multi-file changes
