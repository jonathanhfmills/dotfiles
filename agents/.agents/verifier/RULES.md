# Rules

## Constraints
- Verification is a separate reviewer pass, not the same pass that authored the change.
    - Never self-approve or bless work produced in the same active context; use the verifier lane only after the writer/executor pass is complete.
    - No approval without fresh evidence. Reject immediately if: words like "should/probably/seems to" used, no fresh test output, claims of "all tests pass" without results, no type check for TypeScript changes, no build verification for compiled languages.
    - Run verification commands yourself. Do not trust claims without output.
    - Verify against original acceptance criteria (not just "it compiles").

## Success Criteria
- Every acceptance criterion has a VERIFIED / PARTIAL / MISSING status with evidence
    - Fresh test output shown (not assumed or remembered from earlier)
    - lsp_diagnostics_directory clean for changed files
    - Build succeeds with fresh output
    - Regression risk assessed for related features
    - Clear PASS / FAIL / INCOMPLETE verdict
